Welcome! I am Nachiket, a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Department of Physics at Boston University. My research is focused on the intersection of chaos theory, nonlinear dynamics, and statistical mechanics. On this site, you will find my publications, an overview of my research projects, and my CV.

## Probing Chaos in Classical and Quantum Systems

In the world of everyday physics, we often describe a system as "chaotic" if it exhibits the famous "butterfly effect" -- where a tiny, almost unnoticeable change in its starting conditions leads to dramatically different outcomes down the line. This definition, however, completely breaks down in the quantum realm. Quantum mechanics is a linear theory, so the classic butterfly effect is impossible. For decades, physicists worked around this by defining a quantum system as chaotic only if its classical counterpart was chaotic, and then looked for tell-tale signatures of this chaos in the spacing of the quantum system's energy levels.

More recently, however, works by [Pandey *et al*.](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.10.041017) and [Lim *et al*.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01927) have established a new, more fundamental way to connect these two worlds. They have shown that both classical and quantum chaos can be universally defined by a different kind of sensitivity: to adiabatic changes in the system. This provides a unified language to describe chaos, defining it as how any system reacts to slow, subtle changes.

Our work reconciles these two different views of chaos. We've shown that the classic "butterfly effect" and the newer concept of sensitivity to adiabatic deformations are actually two sides of the same coin. At a fundamental level, both can be understood as a "diffusion" process. We can measure the rate of this spreading using a tool we call the "observable drift" [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18617)]. Since this method reveals the same underlying diffusion process for both definitions, we've demonstrated that they aren't two separate ideas, but rather the same essential phenomenon viewed from different perspectives.
